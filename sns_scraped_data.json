      "Vigneshwaran Ganapathi from SNS College of Technology is recognized for his book \"DESIGN THINKING AND SOLVING VISION\" which is dedicated to all Engineers, Pursuing Engineering Students, Design Thinking Learners, Science Explorers and Educational Institutions. Vignesh states, \" It makes me elated to share my thoughts about SNS and how it has inspired bringing awesomeness to create a book as well as in students engineering life event. It was 2017, I was admitted to SNS college of technology after two years of tragedy in my schooling. It received me with a good hold that taught me how engineering is going to be in the coming years.\" During the first three semesters of Vignesh, DT was absolutely different. Yes \"DT\" meant here is Daily Test, he used to write this every working day morning shuffling with the neighboring class with zero conversions. After his 3rd semester, it started with the boot camp of DT, Now the transformation is very absolute, \"DT\" termed here is Design Thinking.",
      "Then Vignesh engaged with the neighboring classes every morning first hour, but this time with his own juniors and seniors with the reciprocal to the word \"zero conversation\". \"We learned many things irrespective of juniors, seniors and even teachers, this brings a huge motive to create and solve something. We share the progress with each, worked as a team to solve the problem statement that we drafted and prototyped in the boot camp,\" says Vignesh.",
      "According to me Engineering is to make something happen in an efficient way, the concept of engineering is zero when there is lack of efficiency in a process than the previous one. Yes, Design Thinking absolutely worked on this statement and encountered more efficiency in engineering and architectural studies. I felt this itself an inspiration to create and regulate something for mankind. It also ignited my vision on creating a book.",

      "CARDIO PULMONARY PERFUSION CARE TECHNOLOGY",
      "B.Sc. Cardio Pulmonary Perfusion Care Technology (CPPCT) is an Undergraduate Program offered by SNS College of Allied Health Sciences. Certain procedures require the Cardio-Thoracic surgeon to work on a Stopped Heart, and it is required to temporarily replace the patient's heart and lung function. During these surgical operations, the perfusionist (a candidate completing the B. Sc (Cardio Pulmonary Perfusion Care Technology Course), a skilled healthcare practitioner, is responsible for taking over the function of the heart and/or lungs.",
      "While the surgeon works on the heart, a perfusionist controls a heart-lung machine, which is an artificial blood pump that pumps oxygenated blood to the patient's tissues. While the cardiac surgeon performs on the heart, the perfusionist regulates the patient's physiological and metabolic demands. The perfusionist is also in charge of administering the medicine that stops the heart.",

Prakash was always dedicated to his practice and spent countless hours perfecting his style and to draw the pictures using different techniques. One of his best qualities that he had trained on his sketching is he was inspired by the modern artist , that made him choose the Pen sketching.\n\nOne day, Prakash heard about the online event and decided to participate. He knew it would be a great opportunity to showcase his skills on an online platform.All the skills that he has been training to showcase have got an opportunity to exhibit .",
      "With the support of her institution and staff, Prakash trained harder than ever before. His family has always been her inspiration, and was there to encourage his every step of the way. They had instilled in him the importance of perseverance and dedication, and Prakash had taken those values to heart.",
      "Finally, the day of the exhibition of his talent not even a second he had doubt on him . Prakash was nervous but determined to give it his all and gave his best shot to draw three leaders painting using pen in the shortest span of 5 min and 47 seconds.\n\nHe was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. He knew that he could not have achieved this without the support of his SNS institution, staff, and most importantly, his family . He dedicated the win to his family and promised to continue working hard to make them proud.",

His father first exposed him to the karate world when he was in eighth standard. He eventually earned a black belt.Abinesh was immediately impressed and began routinely travelling to his neighbourhood to train. He ultimately attained the black belt.\nAs he grew older, his passion for karate never waned. He trained harder every day, determined to become the best. His dream was to become a national champion, and he worked tirelessly towards his goal. His efforts paid off when he was selected to represent the country at the National Karate Championship.\nThe competition was tough, and he was up against some of the best karate students in the country. But he was undaunted. He had trained hard for this moment, and he was determined to make the most of it. His performance was flawless, and he fought with skill and determination. His fellow competitors were impressed with his moves, and they knew they had a formidable opponent.",
      "The final results were announced, and Abinesh secured second place. He was ecstatic. It was a huge achievement for him, and he felt proud of himself for having come so far. He was also proud of his father, who had been his inspiration,he is often a role model, mentor, and guide who can teach valuable life lessons through his actions and words.Has able to make new friends and relationships with people who have similar interests and passions by taking part in the tournament. For developing a professional network and improving one's horizons, this can be enormously helpful.The possibility for healthy competition and the chance to learn from individuals who are at a similar stage of their jobs or interests make competing with people in your own age group extremely rewarding. He has improved his knowledge towards the strengths and weaknesses, acquired new abilities, or mastered new approaches or strategies.\nThe college held a special celebration to greet him where students and staff members gave him gratitude. The staff, the HOD, and the management were all delighted with his performance, and they praised him for his hard work and commitment to it. Abinesh was overwhelmed with their support and encouragement. He knew that he could not have achieved his dream without their help.\nAbinesh's family was also proud of him. They had watched him train tirelessly for months, and they were thrilled to see him achieve his dream. Abinesh knew that he had made them proud, and that was the most important thing to him.\nIn the end, he learned that with hard work, dedication, and the support of everyone around him, anything was possible. He had achieved his dream, and he knew that he had a bright future ahead of him. He continued to train hard, and he knew that he would achieve even greater things in the future.",

At the initial stage, he was very skinny but he had a dream to have a muscular body, so he started going to the gym to gain weight. He started lifting more weights to gain muscular structure and even participated in the various contests but he couldn’t get into the first 10 rankings which questioned his effort. He faced a lot of troubles by then, people started to mock him where he felt very low. Many teased Richard, that he cannot lift those weights and he is not worth to be a lifter. But he didn’t stop his practice. structure and even participated in the various contests but he couldn’t get into the first 10 rankings which questioned his effort. He faced a lot of troubles by then, people started to mock him where he felt very low. Many teased Richard, that he cannot lift those weights and he is not worth to be a lifter. But he didn’t stop his practice.",
      "Mr. Santhosh MFP - My coach, who helped me in all aspects from weight management, form positioning, diet, and so on.

      "\"PEDAL TO THE RHYTHM OF THE WIND AND LET THE JOURNEY BE YOUR DESTINATION.\"",
      "Cycling is a sport that requires dedication, hard work, and perseverance. Pursuing this sport can be challenging, but it becomes much easier with the support of one's college and family. In this article, we will discuss the importance of support from family and educational institutions for cycling and how it has helped a student in our college achieve remarkable success in this sport.\n\nOur college has always encouraged its students to participate in extracurricular activities, including sports. One such person who has been actively pursuing cycling is Jeevanandhan. E is a Bsc.IT 2nd year student at Dr.SNS Rajalakshmi College of Arts and Science from Tirupattur.His goal is to cover the whole world by bicycle. From a young age, Jeeva had a passion for cycling, and this passion has only grown stronger with time",
      "Our college has provided Jeeva with numerous opportunities to participate in cycling events and competitions. It has recognized his achievements in this sport and provided him with the necessary equipment and resources to pursue his passion. Recently, Jeeva achieved the Kalam's Award for cycling non-stop from Chennai to Coimbatore within 30 hours on a single-speed mountain bike. This is an incredible achievement, and it is a testament to his dedication, perseverance, and hard work.\n\nHe expresses gratitude to his institution, staff, family, friends, the police, clubs, and everyone else who has ever been there for him. The assistance in ensuring that the road was clear and secure was priceless, and their presence made the ride much more enjoyable. His dedication to protecting bikers' safety Because he was on the road, he felt much safer and was free to enjoy the ride without worrying about other people or potential dangers.\n\nThe success of Jeeva in cycling is an inspiration to all of us. It shows that with dedication, hard work, and the support of college and family, he made everything possible. It also highlights the importance of providing young people with their own opportunities to pursue their interests and develop their skills and talents. Our college support is crucial in helping young people pursue their passions and achieve their goals. The success of Jeeva in cycling is a testament to this, and we hope that it will inspire others to pursue their passions with dedication, perseverance, and the support of their educational institutions and families.",

      "\"CALCULATING WITH THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS: THE TIMELESS ABACUS\"",
      "Sahasrasarayu.S, who is studying at UKG in the SNS Academy, is a young child with high aspirations. She was always amazed by numbers and loved nothing more than figuring out math problems. She trains at National Kids, where she is a renowned student with a concentration in mental arithmetic. Sarayu learned the skill of abacus solving. She found the idea fascinating and soon started showing up to classes frequently. For two years, she practiced daily, putting a lot of effort into improving her skills. Her commitment and diligence soon proved useful.",
      "Her teacher once announced a contest to gauge the students' skills. It was necessary to resolve as many abacus puzzles as you could in less than five minutes. She was determined to do her best and started practising relentlessly. She would solve problems even while waiting for the school bus or during her lunch break.\nSarayu was both anxious and eager as the competition day approached. She settled in with the other pupils and awaited the start of the countdown. As soon as the timer went off, her fingers zipped over the abacus beads, answering each problem with amazing quickness and perfection.\nSarayu set a new competition record by resolving 91 issues in 4 minutes and 54 seconds, which surprised the judges. She was praised by her classmates and parents, who were impressed by her talent and diligence. She achieved Kalam book of world Records.\nShe had the support and encouragement from SNS Academy ,school's principal, staff, and administration. Sarayu's family was delighted and prompted her to carry on sharpening her abilities.\nHer commitment and diligence paid off, and she experienced great success in life, inspiring many students to explore similar goals. Sarayu was able to realize her goals and scale new heights in both her academic and personal lives because of the support of her family and school.",

      "BRING OUT THE FIGHTER IN YOU",
      "Nagendran is a student from SNS College of Engineering, Pursuing a major in Electronics and Communication Engineering. His practice for Karate started when he was in 5th Standard. He shares that he loves watching Jackie Chan movies and the fight skills of Chan inspired Nagendran to learn Karate.",
      "Nagendran reveals that his father made the right decision on making him joining the Karate class for his fruitful future. And his mom played an important role in the Karate life of Nagendran by waking him in the early morning at 4.30 A.M. and his dad was a travel partner to drop down him in the class. And Nagendran's turning point in hopeless life started to get brighter because of his karate masters - Mr. Shanmugam, Mr. Muthuraj, Mr. Karthick and Mr. Prem. The training masters of Nagendran helped him throughout the journey. When \"I started to place medals in the tournament my master helped me to go higher level official tournaments\", says Nagu.",
      "His first award was to win Gold Medal in the Karate State Championship and also he placed a Bronze Medal in National Level Karate Championship and selected for the Common Wealth Karate Championship. But he couldn't able to win, and he shares that it was one of the greatest experiences in his life. He didn't lose his hope, he continuously started bagging medals in State and National Championship.  Nagendran shares, \"My best success is placing a Gold Medal in the National Championship-2019, held at Chennai and then selected for the AKF(Asian Karate Federation). My family was one of the greatest support in my karate life and my master's training and practice are helping me to achieve more\".",

      "THROUGH THE OZONE LAYER",
      "Preethi Johnson Alumni (2021) from Aeronautical Engineering, SNS College of Technology shares her Successful story here. Hii! This is Preethi, I would like to mention some of my remarkable Achievements. I have placed a Gold medal in the All India National Badminton Championship held at Amritsar Punjab in the year 2019, placed a Silver Medal in Interzonal Badminton Tournament and also placed a Gold Medal in the State and District level Badminton Tournaments. I took my Badminton racquet when I was 12-year-old and it’s been 11 years to date.",
      "I am from a middle-class family where my dad Mr. Joy. Johnson is an electrician and mom Mrs. Malarvizhi is a homemaker and I also have an elder brother who is a differently able child. In my school, my name will always be present in the list of the students who haven’t paid their fees. In spite of the entire financial crisis, my parents were always been there with me supporting me to reach my goal. Soon after my schooling, my only aim was to give my parents a relaxation from my fees. With God’s grace, I stepped into SNS institutions where they respect the young talents and our college management provided me with a full scholarship sports quota. It was motivating me to achieve more and to put more hard work than before which pushed me to step into the National Championship once again and also to win a Gold Medal over there. Now I am into the next milestone of my life hoping that I have a very long way to go with my carrier. I will always be grateful to my College Management, our beloved staffs and my parents who have always been there with me supporting me both physically and mentally to overcome my hurdles.",
